// Test case demonstrating why [$.path, $.type_ptr] conflict is needed

// Case 1: *T.something - Must be a path (type_ptr followed by .method)
fn *T.clone()
    pass

// Case 2: fn returning *T - Just a type_ptr (no dot after)
fn get_ptr() -> *T
    pass

// The parser seeing "*T•" doesn't know yet if:
// - There's a "." coming (path with method call)
// - Nothing coming (just a type_ptr)
//
// This creates an unavoidable shift/reduce conflict that requires
// lookahead to resolve.
